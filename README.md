# Raw-Integer-Coordinates-into-Stretched-Image-LiDAR-MATLAB
while gathering raw LiDAR Data and reading it into normal integers to play with my own personal dataSets for machine learning instead of using MATLABS proprietary ones, I decded to play around the process for stretching the image out -created by the coordinates- in order to reach the desired size for manipulation, So I decided to move the data around such as stretching the array, while also adding the headers in automatically whenever this section runs to make the matrix meet the Semantic Segmentation Algorithms ImageInput requirements
