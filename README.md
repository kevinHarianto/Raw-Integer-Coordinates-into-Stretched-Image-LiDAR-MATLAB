# Raw-Integer-Coordinates-into-Stretched-Image-LiDAR-MATLAB
After gathering raw LiDAR Data and reading it into normal integers first, I wanted to play around the process for stretching the image out -created by the coordinates- in order to reach the desired size for manipulation, So I decided to play around with the coordinates such as stretching the array, while also adding the headers in automatically whenever this section runs
